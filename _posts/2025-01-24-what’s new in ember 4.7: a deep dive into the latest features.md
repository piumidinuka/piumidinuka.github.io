Ember.js has long been a favorite among developers for building ambitious web applications. Known for its convention-over-configuration approach, strong ecosystem, and commitment to long-term stability, Ember continues to evolve with each new release. In this post, we’ll dive into Ember 4.7, the latest stable version of the framework, and explore the new features, improvements, and best practices it brings to the table

Ember 4.7 builds upon the solid foundation established by previous versions, adding enhancements that improve the developer experience and ensure better performance and ease of use. Whether upgrading an existing Ember app or starting a new project, this release provides valuable tools that can help streamline your development process and deliver more powerful web applications.

Let’s look at what’s new in Ember 4.7 and how these updates can benefit you as a developer.

# 1. New Features and Enhancements in Ember 4.7
Ember 4.7 introduces several new features and improvements aimed at making the framework even more robust and developer-friendly. Here are the key highlights:

## 1.1. Enhanced Template Glimmer Support
One of the most significant improvements in Ember 4.7 is the enhanced Glimmer rendering engine support. Glimmer is the framework’s rendering engine, responsible for converting your templates into DOM elements efficiently. With Ember 4.7, Glimmer’s performance has been further optimized, enabling faster rendering and better handling of large lists and complex templates.

The improvements also ensure that tracked properties work seamlessly with Glimmer, giving developers more control over their app’s reactivity and state management.

## 1.2. Upgraded TypeScript Support
Ember 4.7 continues to improve its TypeScript support, making it easier to build strongly typed applications. In this release, TypeScript definitions have been improved, providing more accurate intellisense and better tooling for developers working in TypeScript.

By using TypeScript with Ember, you can reduce the risk of runtime errors and ensure your codebase remains maintainable as it grows. This update brings you closer to a fully type-safe development environment.

## 1.3. Improved Development Experience with New Ember CLI Commands
With the latest version of Ember CLI in 4.7, the development experience is more streamlined than ever. A number of new CLI commands have been introduced to simplify everyday tasks, such as adding or removing dependencies and generating components or services. The ember dev command now offers faster rebuilds, giving you a quicker feedback loop during development.

This means less waiting and more coding, improving your overall development productivity.

## 1.4. Performance Improvements and Smaller Build Sizes
Ember 4.7 also comes with numerous under-the-hood performance optimizations that reduce memory usage and improve the speed of rendering and routing. One of the standout improvements is faster initial page load times, which will improve the user experience, particularly in large applications.

Additionally, build sizes have been reduced thanks to updates in Ember's tree-shaking process. This results in smaller bundle sizes and quicker download times for your users.

# 2. Deprecations and Breaking Changes in Ember 4.7
As with any new release, Ember 4.7 also includes some deprecations and breaking changes that developers need to be aware of when upgrading their projects. Here’s what you need to know:

## 2.1. Deprecation of Ember.computed
One of the most significant deprecations in Ember 4.7 is the move away from the legacy Ember.computed API. As part of the long-term vision to modernize the framework, the @tracked decorator is now the recommended way to manage computed properties in Ember.

For developers upgrading from earlier versions of Ember, it’s important to refactor your computed properties to use @tracked instead. The good news is that this change makes your codebase more aligned with modern JavaScript patterns and can simplify state management.

## 2.2. Removal of Legacy ember-data Features
Another change to keep in mind is the removal of some legacy features in ember-data. The Ember Data team has been working on modernizing the library, and as part of this effort, older APIs and functionality have been deprecated and removed. If your app relies on deprecated ember-data features, you may need to update your models or change how you handle relationships between records.

## 2.3. Updated Router Behavior
In Ember 4.7, the router behavior has been updated to handle nested routes more efficiently. This may require some changes to how you structure your route definitions, especially if you’re using nested routes extensively in your app.

To ensure your routes function as expected after upgrading, you should thoroughly test your routing logic and check for any unexpected behavior.

# 3. Migration Tips for Upgrading to Ember 4.7
If you're migrating an existing project to Ember 4.7, here are a few tips to help you navigate the transition smoothly:

## 3.1. Upgrade Dependencies Gradually
Start by upgrading your project’s dependencies, including Ember CLI, Ember Data, and any add-ons you use. Be sure to check the release notes for each dependency to ensure compatibility with Ember 4.7.

## 3.2. Refactor Deprecated APIs
If you’re using deprecated APIs like Ember.computed or legacy Ember Data features, begin the process of refactoring your code. Ember’s official deprecation guides are a great resource for understanding the changes and ensuring your code remains future-proof.

## 3.3. Test Thoroughly
Ember’s new features and breaking changes can sometimes introduce subtle issues. It’s crucial to run your tests regularly during the upgrade process. Using tools like ember-cli-mocha or ember-qunit for testing will help catch any issues early.

## 3.4. Update Add-ons
Make sure that the add-ons you use in your Ember app are compatible with Ember 4.7. You can find the latest compatibility information on the add-on’s GitHub page or Ember Observer.

# 4. Conclusion
Ember 4.7 brings exciting new features, performance improvements, and a cleaner development experience for building modern web applications. While there are some breaking changes and deprecations to be aware of, the benefits of upgrading are clear: enhanced performance, improved TypeScript support, and a more streamlined development process.

As always, make sure to test thoroughly when upgrading to Ember 4.7, and take advantage of the powerful new features to build more efficient and scalable apps. 

**Happy coding!**
