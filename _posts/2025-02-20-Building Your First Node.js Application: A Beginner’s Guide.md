Starting a basic Node.js project is simple and a great way to get familiar with the Node.js runtime.\
Below is a step-by-step guide to help you create a simple Node.js project,\
which can be expanded upon as you gain more experience.

# Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

If you haven't installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) yet, you can download and install the latest version from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en).

To check if you have Node.js installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41b56a12-0c52-4943-b667-de090f03fb1a)

This will display the version of Node.js and npm installed. If you see the version numbers, you're all set!

# Step 2: Initialize the Project

**Create a New Folder for Your Project:**

**2. Initialize the Project with npm: Inside your project folder, initialize a new Node.js project with the following command:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf18767f-7918-4be5-8219-3cfd795c9376)

This will create a package.json file with default values. This file is essential for managing project dependencies, scripts, and other settings.

# Step 3: Create the server.js File

**1. Inside your project folder, create a file called server.js:**

**2.Open the server.js file in your preferred text editor (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.), and add the following code to create a basic HTTP server:**

# Step 4: Run the Server

**1. In the terminal, run your server.js file using the following command:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92b71eba-f191-42ef-8045-4fd4ea46fa1c)

**2.You should see the message:**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2eb7008-a7bb-489c-9d18-0af1f1d3ba71)

**3. Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:3000/. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.**

# Step 5: Add More Functionality (Optional)
You can extend the project by adding routing, handling different HTTP methods, or using frameworks like ***Express.js***.

**Example: Adding Routing with Express.js**

**1. First, install the Express.js package:**

**2. Modify the server.js to use Express.js for routing:**

**3. Run your application again with node server.js and visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/about to see the "About" page.**

# Step 6: Use Nodemon for Development (Optional)

To make development easier, you can use Nodemon, which automatically restarts your server when you make changes to your code.

**1. Install Nodemon as a development dependency**

**2. Modify your package.json file to add a script for running your server with Nodemon:**

**3. Now you can start your server with:**

# Conclusion

You've now set up a basic Node.js project! Here's a recap of what we did:

+ **Initialized the project** using npm.
+ **Created a basic HTTP server** with Node.js.
+ **Optionally extended** the project using Express.js for routing.
+ **Used Nodemon** for easier development.

As you continue to explore Node.js, you can build more complex applications by adding databases, authentication, error handling, and more.\
***Happy coding!***
